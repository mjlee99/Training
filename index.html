    <p>In general, stars are big gas balls that emit light. There are nuclear reactions in them, and around, the planets are often spinning. They are divided into classes depending on the spectrum. According to scientists, they appeared as a result
      of
      a big explosion, like everything else. They are observed in telescopes for study. The science of studying celestial bodies is called astronomy. There is still astrology, but it's hard to call it science. It deals with the signs of the zodiac,
      which, by the way, is also in Unicode.</p>
